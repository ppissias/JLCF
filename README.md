# JLCF
Java Lightweight Component Framework

![alt tag](manual/component_cloud.jpg)

The Java Light Component Framework (JLCF) is a framework for developing modular applications for the java language. It allows designing an application using building blocks with well-defined inputs and outputs (aka software components). Using this well-defined modular approach, the application has a clear and explicit design which facilitates the development and maintenance of a software system.

JLCF focuses on usability on a simple programming model and also provides advanced features such as interceptors, callbacks and dynamic component replacement.

The user manual of JLCF, containing all of its concepts and eamples can be downlosded here:
